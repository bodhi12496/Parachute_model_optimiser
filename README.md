# Parachute model optimizer

A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag . A major application is to support people, for recreation or as a safety device for aviators, who can exit from an aircraft at height and descend safely to earth. There are several important factors which are important in the making of a parachute. These include:
- Theoretical Drag Coefficient (Dependent on the shape of the parachute)
- Velocity at which the parachute is travelling
- Canopy area
- Density of the medium it is travelling
The Drag force exerted by a fluid on the parachute is given by the formula:

F = 1/2 *œÅAv^2C

Where:
F= Drag force exerted by the fluid
p= Density of fluid
A= area of parachute
C=Coefficient of drag

The coefficient of drag of a parachute depends on the material and the shape of the parachute.


## Tech Stack

 Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Arduino 



##  Objectives:

- evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of different parachute designs and made decisions on optimal deployment by using experimental data and plotting it and making regression analysis with the ML tool.
- The developed model data was used to predict and calculate the effect of the other parameters on the drag force.
